refactor: apply auth-style separation of concerns to documents + consolidate JWT types

DOCUMENTS MODULE REFACTORING:
• Refactored document service to follow auth pattern with standardized result objects
• Moved business logic from controller to service layer for better maintainability  
• Updated document models with consistent result interfaces (UploadDocumentResult, ListDocumentsResult, etc.)
• Cleaned up controller to focus on request/response handling only
• Fixed response structure alignment between service and controller
• Updated all tests to work with new result pattern
• Maintained full backward compatibility

JWT TYPE CONSOLIDATION:
• Created jwt.models.ts following established domain models pattern
• Removed duplicate JWT types from auth.models.ts and jwt.interface.ts
• Consolidated JWTPayload, TokenPair, and related types into single source
• Updated all imports across codebase (jwt.service.ts, auth.middleware.ts, services/index.ts)
• Added JWT types to centralized service exports for consistency
• Eliminated interfaces/ directory pattern in favor of models/ consistency
• Fixed UserRole import conflicts and type consistency issues

BENEFITS:
• Consistent separation of concerns across all modules
• Single import point for all service types
• Better maintainability and developer experience
• Reduced code duplication and improved type safety
• All tests passing (401 passed, same 2 pre-existing failures unrelated to changes)
