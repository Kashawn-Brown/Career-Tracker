Overview
Task-Master is a full-stack job application tracker designed to replace traditional spreadsheets and help users manage and analyze their job search. It provides a structured, editable, and expandable table view where users can log job applications, add details (like documents, deadlines, and notes), and track progress. It is valuable for job seekers who want to stay organized, take actionable steps (e.g., follow-ups), and eventually view meaningful job search statistics.

Core Features
🧾 Spreadsheet-Style Application Table
What it does: Displays job applications in a grid/table format with editable cells for fields like company, position, status, etc.

Why it’s important: Mimics the familiarity of Excel/Notion while offering structured and persistent data storage.

How it works: Each job is a row. Fields like status, type, tags, and salary are edited in place. Long text fields and uploads open in modals or slideovers.

📄 Expandable Details
What it does: Allows the user to expand certain fields (e.g., job description, notes, referrals, uploaded documents) for rich interaction.

Why it’s important: Keeps the UI clean while enabling full details and editing per row.

How it works: Clicking specific cells opens a modal or slideover for editing/viewing.

📤 File Uploads
What it does: Users can upload resumes and cover letters per job application.

Why it’s important: Centralizes all related job materials.

How it works: Files are uploaded and linked to a job entry, shown in expandable view.

📊 Basic Stats Display
What it does: Shows summary stats like total applications. Option to expand for more analytics (apps per day/status/type/etc.).

Why it’s important: Gives users insight into their job search progress.

How it works: Calculated via backend queries and displayed at the bottom or in a slideout dashboard.

🧷 Tags & Favorites
What it does: Users can tag applications and mark them as favorites.

Why it’s important: Enables filtering, prioritization, and categorization.

How it works: Tags are stored as multi-select options per application. Star/favorite is a boolean toggle.

⏰ Deadlines and Follow-Up Dates
What it does: Users can set follow-up reminders and deadlines.

Why it’s important: Helps ensure users don’t miss time-sensitive actions.

How it works: Stored as optional dates on each job; backend can later be extended to send reminders.

📩 Global User Reference Panel
What it does: Stores default resume and links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email) at top of page.

Why it’s important: Quickly accessible while applying.

How it works: Simple top bar that stores persistent user info.

🔄 CSV Import/Export
What it does: Allows users to back up or migrate data via CSV.

Why it’s important: Ensures data portability and reliability.

How it works: Backend provides endpoints to export filtered application data or import from template.

User Experience
👤 User Personas
Solo job seeker: Wants an easy way to log and revisit job applications.

Ambitious applicant: Applies to many jobs weekly, needs structure and reminders.

Organizer type: Wants to track custom fields, tags, and metadata for every job.

🔁 Key User Flows
Add job application → Fill in core fields in table → Upload resume → Add notes

Edit application → Click cell → Inline edit or open modal

Expand job details → Click row or “details” → View/edit job description, recruiter info, docs

Set follow-up date → Click deadline field → Date picker → Save

View stats → Scroll down → View totals → Click “More Stats”

Download/export → Click “Export CSV” → Download job list

🧠 UI/UX Considerations
Editable table must feel fast and familiar (Notion/Airtable-like)

Use modals/slideovers for long-form content to avoid clutter

Mobile responsiveness not a priority for MVP, but layout should degrade gracefully

Dark mode toggle for comfort

Keyboard-friendly controls in future for power users

Technical Architecture
System Components
Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI

Backend: Fastify (TypeScript), Prisma ORM

Database: PostgreSQL (Railway-hosted)

File Storage: Local for MVP or Cloudinary if online

Deployment: Railway for backend and DB, Vercel or Railway for frontend

Data Models (simplified)
User

id, email, name, resumeLink, githubLink, linkedinLink

JobApplication

id, userId (FK), company, position, dateApplied, status, type, salary, jobLink, compatibilityScore, notes, isStarred, followUpDate, deadline

Tags

id, label, jobApplicationId (FK)

People

id, name, role, jobApplicationId (FK)

Document

id, fileUrl, type (resume/cover), jobApplicationId (FK)

APIs
REST endpoints for:

CRUD for job applications

File uploads

Tagging and starring

Stats generation

Import/export CSV

Development Roadmap
✅ MVP Requirements

Resume/GitHub/LinkedIn links (per user)

CSV import/export

Dark mode

🚀 Future Enhancements
Authentication and multi-user system

Advanced stats dashboard with filters

Reminder notifications

Admin dashboard for support users

Collaborative view (shared job boards)

LinkedIn integration for suggested contacts

Timeline tracking (e.g., app to interview to offer)

Logical Dependency Chain
Database schema & models

Backend API routes for CRUD and file handling

Frontend table UI (read-only)

Inline editing & form controls

Expandable modals for job description, people, notes, files

Basic stats calculation

Upload support

Tagging & favoriting

Global user panel setup

CSV import/export

Styling and dark mode toggle

Risks and Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Schema drift or poorly structured data	Use Prisma and define schema with migrations
Over-engineering features too early	Stick to MVP list, defer all multi-user work
UI becoming too cluttered	Use modals, slideovers, and collapsible views
Deployment complexity	Use Railway and Vercel for simplified deploys
File uploads and storage issues	Use local storage initially or Cloudinary later
Stats performance on large datasets	Optimize queries with indexing and caching later

Appendix
PRD created for Task-Master by refining feature and architecture discussions.

Inspired by Notion/Airtable UI with CRUD/backend separation.

Database: PostgreSQL selected for structured schema and future scalability.

Stack: Next.js (TS), Tailwind, ShadCN, Fastify, Prisma, Railway/Vercel.

Dark mode, tagging, analytics, and file upload included from MVP.
