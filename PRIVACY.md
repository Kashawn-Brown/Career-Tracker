# Privacy Policy

Career-Tracker stores the minimum information needed to provide the service, such as your account details (e.g., email and authentication data) and any job-tracking content you choose to enter (applications, notes, connections, etc.).

If you upload documents, files are stored using a cloud storage provider and linked to your account for download/delete functionality.

If you use AI features, the text you submit (e.g., job descriptions and other inputs) is sent to an AI provider to generate structured outputs and scoring. These requests are processed to provide the feature and are not sold.

Career-Tracker uses third-party services to operate (hosting, database, email delivery, storage, and AI processing). Data is not sold to third parties.

_This project is actively developed and this policy may change._
